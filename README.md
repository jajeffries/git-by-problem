# Git By Problem

I've been thinking for a while that it would be useful to know what to do when you break something and want to fix it with git. Learning the whole of git is a pretty daunting task, so a collection of one liners categorised into how and when they should be used is pretty useful. Hopefully over time people will start to understand more about how git works.
